# Multilingual RAG

## Background  
The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks. However, most pre-trained models are predominantly optimized for monolingual or high-resource languages, leading to significant challenges in multilingual contexts:  
- **Semantic Misinterpretation**: Non-multilingual pre-trained models often struggle with accurate understanding in multilingual environments.  
- **Limited Comprehension**: These models exhibit reduced performance in handling low-resource languages and complex language-switching scenarios.  

To address these challenges, this project explores **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, integrating multilingual databases and advanced retrieval-generation capabilities to enhance LLMs' performance in multilingual contexts.

## Summary  
**Multilingual RAG** is a system built on the LangChain framework, designed to mitigate the limitations of non-multilingual pre-trained models in multilingual environments. The project features the following key components:  
1. **RAG System Design**: Combines retrieval and generation capabilities to integrate multilingual structured and unstructured data, enhancing reasoning and contextual understanding.  
2. **LangChain Integration**: Utilizes LangChain to construct flexible multilingual task pipelines, enabling dynamic knowledge retrieval and generation.  
3. **Multilingual Support**: Leverages a multilingual database to optimize performance, facilitating robust semantic reasoning and question-answering in diverse linguistic scenarios.  

This project offers an innovative solution to improve LLMs' capabilities in multilingual settings, with applications in cross-lingual question answering, translation augmentation, and multilingual knowledge management.
